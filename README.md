# TASK 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction
## Introduction
* Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a
passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner
project with readily available data.
* The dataset typically used for this project contains information
about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket
class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
## Features
Utilizes Python for building the Titanic Survival Prediction model.
Applies machine learning algorithms for training and classification.
Implements label encoding to transform categorical data.
Uses Logistic Regression for the classification task.
Allows for custom prediction inputs.

# TASK 2 - MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
## Introduction
* Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem.
* The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
critics.
* Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data
analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the Movie rating prediction with python. The project will involve collecting relevant data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Requirements
To run the notebooks and reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
* **Python (version 3.6 or higher)**
* **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**
* **Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,etc.)**

# TASK -3 Iris Flower Classification
This repository contains the code for training a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements. The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, each having distinct measurement characteristics. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers based on their measurements.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris flower dataset, which is commonly used for classification tasks. It includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each species. The dataset is available in the repository as iris.csv.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Seaborn**
* **Matplotlib**

## Model Training
The code for training the classification models can be found in the iris_classification.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. Three different models are trained:

* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
* **Logistic Regression**
* **Decision Tree Classifier**
* **Each model is trained using the Iris flower dataset and evaluated for its accuracy**

## Testing
After training the models, a new test dataset is used to assess their performance. The test dataset contains measurements of Iris flowers with unknown species. The trained models predict the species of these flowers, and their accuracy is evaluated.
